        "description": "ORIGINAL PROMPT:\nIt starts off in a court room in the beginning of a trial with a judge naming off heinous crimes that the defendant has committed.  Panning over to see the defendant looking like a total scumbag, but not seeing his lawyer.   The Judge finishes reading the crimes and then asks, \"Heavy Metal Lawyer how does your defendant plead?\" Camera cuts to the lawyer who's dressed in flamboyant (and terrible) 80's hair metal spandex and clothes, Heavy Metal Lawyer stands up seriously with a guitar and busts out a ridiculous guitar solo.  Cut back to the Judge looking shocked and enthralled as he exclaims \"Case Dismissed!\" The lawyer goes back to soloing as the defendant celebrates.",

Bluish, early morning, pre-dawn light. Sleeping person in bed rolls over (or sits up) and hits alarm off lethargically. Appearance is bedraggled.\n\nSecond shot:\n Person (obviously athletic) back to camera pulling on t-shirt, looking more awake, maybe even a little energetic.\n\nThird shot:\n Foot propped up on edge of a chair. Lacing up running shoes with vigor and purpose. \n \nFourth shot: (or sequence):\n Hops up on chair. Suddenly kicks chair away. Legs now dangling, maybe twitch once or twice.\n \nFinal shot:\n Zoom in on the sneaker logo, legs gently rocking. (if brave use Nike shoes)",

So the joke is I didn't have an idea. Hipsterlicious, I know. We could call it \"Iunno\" or something. I was originally thinking of being on the computer screen through Skype or pre-recorded video and shrugging but I get the feeling that might not fly. Either way, hope you like the idea.

        "description": "ORIGINAL PROMPT:\n\"What I had in mind was something like this: Indoor-Night, there's some people playing an intense game of poker, someone is about to raise a lot of money, but then another player at the table stops him just before he puts the money down and says \"No, wait! The steaks are getting to high\" and then you see 2 T-bones smoking a joint, they take a puff and say \"Oh no, don't mind us, we're cool bro...\"  You're free to change any part of this idea, the lines, the setting, whatever. My suggestion basically is just the play on words on \"Stake/Steak\", and \"High\" of course. If you like the poker/gambling thing you could change the ending by making the steaks really irritated by something a stoner would care about, and call off the game. It's up to you, I'm sure you can make the best of it all... Best wishes :D\"",

I don't know if it is a bad-enough pun, but I came up with this:\n\nTwo people are watching wrestling on the TV sitting on a couch, clearly excited. Then, another one (Subject-C) enters the room and mock them saying: \"Are you watching wrestling? What a marks, men!\" Immediately after saying it, we would change to a close up of the face of Subject-C in which two red dots appear between his eyebrows and he tries to look at the dots astonished. Then we switch to the first two people that are now holding rifles (maybe with the clothes changed now, too) as if they were marksmen (got it? :D) and they say a punchline (I can't come up with anything better than \"you can bet on it\". I'm sure you could best it with ease :P). After that, fade to black and a sound of a shot. END.\n\nI hope it is good enough to make some people laugh.

        "description": "Sometimes I have dreams that I'm back in high school, about to get onstage in \"Inherit the Wind,\" and I've forgotten all my lines as Henry Drummond. I approach the edge of the stage and my father cries, knowing his son is a failure, when I open my mouth and a fully-formed sandwich comes gurgling out.\n\nIt falls into my hands. It's a turkey sandwich with 1 slice of ham for good measure, and ripe cherry tomatoes sliced in half. The lettuce is still wet from being washed, as crisp as the toasted ciabatta bun. The audience is nonplussed, arms folded. They know I don't know my lines. This is not what they paid for.\n\nA cough from the back, signifying nothing. Sometimes it's my mother coughing, other times it's a full-grown bear.\n\nI bring the sandwich to my mouth and begin to take a bite, completely at a loss of what else to do. The crowd erupts in groans of \"Oh come ON\" and \"Of course he'd eat the fucking sandwich\" and \"GET OFF THE STAGE.\" Boos threaten to usurp the student union. And I'm just crying there, mulling the turkey and ciabatta in my mouth. It tastes pretty good.\n\nVine: https://vine.co/5sf\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/5secondfilms\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/5secondfilms\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/5sf\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/5sf",

Just like try and make out. It'll be funny as shit\"\n\n\"Fairy Godmother, why don't your sentences end in punctuation like mine?\"\n\n\"Because ending sentences with periods reminds me of the finality of death and with every year that passes we inch closer and closer towards losing our loved ones and the world we grew up knowing dissolves into a cold, unfeeling place that has no room for our increasingly feeble bodies lol\"",

After he crash-landed the plane, Santa came under inquiry from the courts who deemed him unfit to fly, much like the 2012 movie Flight, directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by John Gatins, starring Denzel Washington and Nadine Velazquez, the plot of which concerns an airline pilot saving almost all his passengers on his malfunctioning airliner which eventually crashed, but an investigation into the accident reveals something troubling.\n\nMerry Christmas and happy IMDB, everyone!",

Waited to see if Santa showed up on the \"Naughty\" No-Fly List. The jokes kept trembling at the cusp of his mouth, dancing on the edge of his lips, a smile threatening to take over his face during every minute of Santa's perfectly average airport ordeal. And finally, this was it. The moment he had been waiting for, falling right into his lap. And even after the thrill had passed, and he massaged his jaw in the terminal bar, he laughed to himself, knowing full well he'd have done it all again. In fact, he was so elated he didn't even care that he forgot to bring the bomb on board.",

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and so it goes that once the mind becomes conditioned to the whipping and the piercing and the scouring, once it comes to crave it, so pleasure thus turns into pain. Soon, the simplest things, such as breathing, feel like you're inhaling glass dust; every swallow, every thrum of the adam's apple, feels like a rock is trapped in your throat, pressing into the glottis and threatening to burst. Even blinking, you can feel your eyelashes threading and splitting again like rows of sharp knives. Soon, the sensation of mites digging and nesting into your eyebrows gives way to a spread of imaginary maggots on your forearms, a hallucination that only be beaten back with more cuts, more whips, more chains. It's a virus that consumes the mind first and travels on to the flesh.\n\nAfter the last deep slash was made on the last untouched vein, their pounding heads drenching the pillows with vile blood, they knew they were damned to circle the endless drain into the afterlife. But it didn't matter. An eternal prison in the attic meant nothing, so long as they were finally set free from the chamber of skin.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

        "description": "Shortly after the divorce hearings, his ex-wife disappeared from the public eye. People thought it was strange because she had such a decisive win. He'd been caught red-handed cheating on her with his TA at the university, and even made plans to run away with her on his boat. That was going to be a lot harder since his ex owned it now, along with the house, two of the cars, and custody of their children.\n\nI should have lawyered up sooner, he thought as he pulled into the driveway for perhaps the last time, taking a sip of his watery iced coffee from the red mug she got him so many birthdays ago. Hopefully she wouldn't be here while he came to collect his things, and there was a good chance of that - friends said they had seen her around the docks a while ago, but his boat was still there. Probably selling it, he mused darkly as he made his way through the front door. What's that old saying? The best two days you have as a boat owner are the day you buy it and the day you sell it. His wry smile turned into a chuckle.\n\nAs his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the house, he felt a headache begin its initial throbbing. He reached out to the bookcase to steady himself, but to his eyes, his arms suddenly looked like they stretched 7 feet out from in front of him, and they still missed the shelf.\n\n\"Honey---Pam?!\" He choked out, failing to catch himself from using the baby talk that had come as second nature to him for so many years. His neck burned and his eyes couldn't focus. He heard singing coming from the kitchen, and like a child learning to ice skate, he hugged the wall as he shuffled one foot in front of the next to get there.\n\nHe rounded the corner of the open door to find Pam lying down with her head turned to the side on the black-and-white tile, her arms bound to her sides with rope. She wasn't breathing.\n\n\"Hope you like your steak medium rare, Miles,\" his TA said, turning around holding a pan that sizzled with olive oil. \"You know how much you preferred my cooking to hers.\"\n\nThe last thing he saw as his head hit the floor was the vacant stare in his wife's dead eyes, looking straight through him with hollow irises. And the last thing he heard was the sound of an electric knife whirring on.",

She predicted the skin sloughing off the infected, the camps within the camps, disembodied hands clinging to orange plastic fences while crops burned in the distance.\n\nShe warned of the madness that would consume the country. Fathers caving in their sons' skulls with rocks, wives tying husbands to their beds in a burning house, dogs roving in packs from house to house, indistinguishable from the furious mobs that looted the homes and businesses. Her own husband, opening his mouth to her in the kitchen to say \"What's wrong with me,\" a faint glimpse of his liver rising up from the back of his throat before his insides evacuated completely.\n\nThe last thing she could see, before she became too scared to keep her eyes closed, was a missile rearing its head to face the sun, rising like a new species set to claim the Earth for itself.\n\nThey all laughed at her. What she didn't predict was how much she'd miss the sound of laughing.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

        "description": "Contrary to the old way of thinking, dogs don't see in black-and-white. Our research has shown that they're limited to gradients of yellow and blue. Or so we think. Because there are colors humans can't see either, pigments that have no precedent, and when it's filtered through our pitiful little world of red, blue and green, we can't even distinguish the hand reaching out to us from the wallpaper, the tongue slithering back down the toilet drain when we open the lid, the tendrils curling around our hearts in the passenger seat of the car, ready to tear it out at moment's notice. Our brains don't just choose not to process the colors - they choose not to accept that a dimension of chaos, living in tandem with ours, even exists.\n\nSo when we analyze what a dog can see, just looking at the raw data, we're only getting half the story, looking at their eyes through our own. We can't look at this image and see what they see.\n\nhttp://public.media.smithsonianmag.com/legacy_blog/rainbow-2.jpg\n\nNow if I told you what was staring back at you from that image, just inches from your face, you wouldn't believe me.

        "description": "The good doctor lost his parents in a car accident when he was 11. His sister was slashed to death the following winter when she fell down in a busy ice skating pond. Since that fateful time, he dedicated himself to the work of replicating life, taking back what was stolen from him. Without love or friendship to distract him, his advancements in the field of cloning surpassed what anyone else would have been capable of dreaming of for another 100 years. Blastocysts dissolved, cells were extracted, failure mounting on top of failure, and yet just as quickly the discoveries and solutions kept coming, science seemingly merging with fiction to unlock the next door in a maze of unvisited hallways. Soon the tendrils of a nervous system found their coating in a mulch of skin, wrapping, forming limbs that could kick, thumbs that could curl. As the scalpel carved away the muck between his first fetus’ trembling head and the petri dish, Phase 2 of his work began. Inoculation.\n\nHe began to invite strangers into his home, daring them to guess the secrets of his incredible findings, letting them scoff and deride his accomplishments as parlor tricks. All the while, he used their cynicism as fodder to keep his likenesses inside, beating it into their heads that the world outside hated and denied them, that he was their only friend, their father, their brother, their Good Doctor. For lack of a frame of reference - there was no TV, and no books in the library but those devoted to science - they had no choice but to obey.\n\nFrom there, the years dragged on, and the clones began to show signs of fatigue. Bloodshot eyes and coughing, constant coughing from every corner of the house. But the Doctor was not In. It was winter, and the pond outside the window had frozen over again. He stared unblinking out the window, more preoccupied with a little girl’s laugh he thought he heard than the coughing and moaning all around him. Until a hand gripped his shoulder.\n\n“What have you done, boy?”\n\nThe doctor turned to see an older, taller man with his face, charred from some horrible burn, blood caked on his ears and down his chest, body covered in black tire tracks, shuffling towards him. Next to him, another clone in a pink dress and pearls, with his jaw snapped off, moaned and dragged closer and closer.\n\n“What have you done to us?”\n\nThe Doctor bumped up against the window when a pair of ice-cold hands burst through the glass to grab him. They belonged to another clone, wracked with 8-inch-long gashes across his forehead, throat and eyes. He whispered in the Doctor’s ear:\n\n“You will always be alone.”\n\nWhen the Doctor came screaming to, he was soaked in sweat on the couch by himself. Not a creak in the floorboards to be heard, no coughing, no broken window, no one to just the crackling of the fireplace and a soft rustle of his unfinished papers. He sipped his coffee and, with a heavy sigh, he took the papers to his study. There was work to be done.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

        "description": "Alistair Preston never appeared to her in the flesh again, in the years that followed. Sometimes she’d catch a reflection in the glass as a door closed shut, other times in the gleaming polished lancewood of a passing coach, but in the split second she saw him, all she could make out was the suit he was buried in, with beams of light blooming from the collar and cuffs. In the Christmas of 1899, the same year she donated her husband’s vast coal fortune to the church and moved in with her sister in San Jacinto, she felt a discordance spreading beneath her feet, like her nerves were violin strings being harshly bowed. Sitting in the kitchen looking into her tea, she saw a ripple trembling outward, and fleetingly glimpsed a hand in the reflection, reaching for her, about to crack the surface of the thin green liquid.\n\nThe crucifix hanging in the foyer shook loose, and as it touched the ground, the earth split open, swallowing the cross, a bearskin rug, a bookshelf, and more every passing second. The knife block in the kitchen tipped over, sending knives spinning up and down the linoleum floor as the house rocked one way, then the other. She hid behind a chair as the roof caved in, the knives sliding past her feet, the candles catching the Christmas holly on fire. She screamed for her sister but didn’t dare move to the drawing room to be with her. As she would soon discover when the earthquake subsided and she stumbled there, it was a wise move. The crossbeams had splintered above, keened down and impaled her sister through the chest, pinning her to the center of the room in a kneeling position, leaking red.\n\nShe nursed a cut on her foot, stained in tea, and wailed up the stairs to the bathroom, which hissed with steam. When she flung open the door, she was astonished to see it was the only room completely untouched in the earthquake. Pristine, even. The other thing that was curious: The sink was filling up with hot water, and just as the water was about to crest over the edge and spill onto the floor, it shut itself off.\n\nShe choked back a sob and slowly limped towards the sink, the long thin mirror dulling her reflection with a thick coat of steam. Gripping the sides of the sink, she knew what had to be done. She pulled her hair back, clenched her teeth, and bent over, dipping her face in.\n\nWhen she adjusted to the heat, she opened her eyes, to find Alistair staring inches from her face. Everything else was darkness.\n\n“Hello, Dear,” he said without moving his lips. “Open your mouth. Let me show you what I found down there amongst the coal.”\n\nFiremen arrived on the scene hours later to the shattered house on the hill, seeing for the first and last time in their lives the sight of a woman drowned whilst standing up. It took the strength of three of them to pull her body from the sink, and when they fell backwards with her frozen body, her face looked like she was at peace, like she had seen something beautiful in the water.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

        "description": "Without the musical genius of The Great Contini, Susan would have never had a singing career. indeed, she would have had nothing - born a girl from the streets, she would as surely have left a damp corpse on those same cobblestones if Contini hadn’t found her singing near a brothel some years back. And in the early going with him, life was easy. The parties, the dresses, the champagne. The champagne.\n\nThe broken champagne glasses. The way he’d slap her in full view of the party, sending her upstairs for her insubordinate behavior. The laughs that echoed up the staircase as he no doubt told some boozy joke to sweep all the ugliness under the rug for their friends. And the way he’d sweet talk her after everyone left, a little-boy’s lilt that oozed conciliation. “You keep me together, Susan,” he’d insist, crocodile tears rolling down his cheeks, using his favored metaphor for her. “You’re my glue.”\n\nYes, in a way, Susan felt she owed her life to him, which would explain the lack of struggle she gave when he wrapped his hands around her throat one week ago. Were he not bleary and blinded with drunken rage, Contini would have thought it odd that her eyes looked so calm even as air seemed to trickle from every pore and duct in her face, like a balloon deflating ever so slightly. Better here than on the streets, he thought to himself with a snicker as he dragged her body into the closet under the stairs.\n\nThe afterlife posed many problems for Susan. Rooms she couldn’t escape, darkness she couldn’t penetrate, people she couldn’t communicate with. There was only this mansion, there was only Contini. And whilst one of them was still living, there was composing to be done. And so the hours beat on, a crumpled page here, a shattered tumbler there. And always, always the pounding of those fists on the keys. But one day, Susan no longer cared if what she did next sent her to Heaven or to Hell. Anything would be better than this house.\n\n“Dammit Susan, for the 50th time-” he bellowed, fists coming down hard on the organ, rattling his glass of scotch. Only this time, his fists didn’t come up to point fingers, or take a swig, or slap the sheet music off the stand. They remained rigid, shaking, stuck to the keys.\n\nHis joints hardened, seemingly crystallizing, elbows bolting themselves to his ribs, blood beginning to trickle from his clenched fingers piercing the pads of his jittering, unmovable hands. Contini tried standing, but the force of his legs pushing against his frozen arms succeeded only in snapping the bone clean off, so that his forearms seemed to bend backwards like a mantis. A roar of pain escaped his mouth as he collapsed forward onto the organ. His cheek became affixed to the cherry wood of the organ, slurring his screams as every twist and exertion seemed to fasten him to the instrument more and more. His ear, his neck, his chest, every part of him crumpled and folded into the body of his most prized possession, the screams merging with the ever-present drone of the sour notes his bleeding fists continued to pound on. It was hard to tell which body was making which sound.\n\nSusan walked over to Contini, or what was still left of him, as his skin began to fracture his bones, then shatter them, then pull them closer and closer into the organ, like a porcelain doll being crushed under an invisible foot. One bugged eye, threatening to pop loose from a quivering, stretching socket, stared at her in fear, the last emotion he could muster before he became nothing but a pile of clothes.\n\n“You always said I was your glue, darling,” she growled.\n\nHis life force subsumed entirely into the organ, the horrendous dirge of notes giving way to a geyser of blood fountaining from the pipes above, coating the ceiling in a shade of crimson and dripping down his sheet music. It was The Great Contini’s final piece - and some would say his most satisfying.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",
