        "description": "After he fucked a frog onstage while screaming \"FAKE NEWS\" in Russian, a fountain of piss exploded and soaked the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, who were singing from blank musical pages in recently-purchased manila folders. The Rockettes were forced to clap as an effigy of Meryl Streep was set on fire.\n\nThe entire gathered news media published nothing but ellipses and the words \"I don't understand\" over and over again. Meanwhile, under cover of night, ninja turtle Mitch McConnell repealed Obamacare and replaced it with a pre-existing condition - racism.\n\nThere, that covers it. Fuck you and fuck this shitty country.",

        "description": "He stalked in the night, waiting for the time to strike. With every blink, he whisked away to another location, another angle, hidden in plain sight. He laid with the rat in the wall, peering back to see the scratchings of its words. He watched the arms of Mr. Shadows stretch into the bathroom, watched the faint burst of light in the distance wash away the creature's features like an acid bath. He witnessed the stitches and staples threading the flesh of Jerry Klobb, heard Ellen's piercing laughter as she punctured his body. When he was finished, he would delete them from existence with a pitch-black shroud and the words THE END. If he chose to restart their cycle of want and torture, he did so with a press of a button. Their lives hung, and hung, and hung again in the balance of his murderous fingers.\n\nThen, when he was through with destroying and rebooting realities, he closed his browser window and resumed working. He never thought much about these lives after he was done with them. He might show the extent of his cruelty to a friend, and see whether they laughed or not. Perhaps sometimes, he'd leave a comment - a humorous pun, a meme, the phrase \"I Am the Plot Twist Killer\" - but he never, ever, ever cared.\n\nAnd why would he? He's you.",

        "title": "My Roommate Mr. Shadows",
        "description": "Andrew had a lot of adjusting to do after moving into the house. He never met the guy whose room he would be inheriting, but he sure collected a lot of men's beauty magazines. The other guy was always hogging the bathroom and never had much to say. And then there was Mr. Shadows.\n\nThe rules of the house, which were posted inside Mr. Shadows' water heater closet where he slept, detailed exactly what humans were and weren't. When they were alive, they were not food. When they were dead and rotting, they were food. If the cops arrived before you could eat the body, they weren't food anymore. And human food was for humans.\n\nMr. Shadows would abuse this last rule time and again, like when he crawled into the refrigerator once the lightbulb broke, or when he ordered raw sausage casings on Amazon as \"snacks for everyone.\" The cake was the last straw, something Andrew's girlfriend left for him in anticipation of his birthday tomorrow. Mr. Shadows saw the cake sort of looked like him, and decided to have it all to himself. He even lit the candle, assuming that's just what one does before eating cake. Of course, lighting it from a distance took some work, and the closer he brought his face to the flame, the more his nose disappeared. He tried to be careful about that, but this time he was just too excited.\n\nNow it was all over the floor, ruined. Andrew threw it away and scolded Shadows for going through his cupboard. Then he retired to the living room, where he slept on the couch while Jerry was still in the process of moving out.\n\nThe sound of wet gristle slapping on the floor woke Andrew up later in the evening. He sat upright on the couch, rubbing his eyes. Then he saw Mr. Shadows, staring out the window.\n\nA house was on fire some number of streets down, illuminating everything in its faraway flicker. It was just bright enough that it managed to shine faintly on Mr. Shadows' face, carving the front of his head away from sight. Only the hollow interior of the back of his head was visible, like a broken mannequin inside an empty store. Then it spoke.\n\n\"So many rules,\" he said to Andrew. \"So many little rules.\" He turned to look at the couch and the half of his face furthest from the window returned to view, revealing half of a wide set of incisors bent in a crooked smile.\n\nThey both heard a muddy thud from the bathroom. Like a body falling. Andrew looked in its direction, praying that Shadows would look too. But he just stared at Andrew with his one visible eye.\n\n\"Sleep well,\" he said, before turning the lights on and skittering to the bathroom. Andrew fell asleep to the churning sounds of chewing and slurping, organs vanishing into an unseen dimension, blood wiping itself off the tile with the sound of deep, sensuous licking.\n\nIt was the last peaceful night's sleep Andrew would get.",

        "title": "To Make The Perfect Man",
        "description": "Ellen had long since been banned from practicing surgery, but they couldn't stop her in time from barricading the men's bathroom door and filling the room with her clothes and soup cans. Police weren't able to make it to the hospital just yet, so until then the staff would have to make sure no one came in or out. It's not like Ellen was capable of much in there anyway.\n\nUntil Jerry stopped by to use the bathroom.\n\nEllen had been screening each potential suitor through a self-made peephole in the door, and finally she found someone knocking on the door who suited her tastes. He just needed a few adjustments.\n\n******\n\nBy the time police finally burst open the door and took Ellen away, Jerry was gone. He stumbled out of the room in a daze, shuffling past his car in the parking lot and onto the long stretch of lonesome road towards home. As his skin loosened around the puncture holes, every step jangled the staples in his face more and more, scraping against the open nerves under his flesh. He couldn't feel it, nor could he care. He was beautiful.\n\nThe blood had congealed over his left eye, shutting it completely. But his right eye could still see through the pinhole of the mask to the outside world, to the mirror in front of him. And what he saw was breathtaking. A bold push-broom mustache, the likes of which he could never grow himself. A strong nose, proud brow. Everything was smooth and pliable. He had achieved his dreams.\n\nIt was a shame, he realized, that the rest of him didn't match up. Everywhere else he looked, he saw the flabby, rough, pale skin of his former self. It sickened him that his old body couldn't live up to the promise of his new face.\n\nHe dug in deep to the skin in the crook of his arm, and pulled. Like wet tissue paper, it sloughed off with a bare squick. He saw the tendons underneath, the beautiful bone. He grabbed more, pulling up his forearm until the flesh inverted around the bones of his fingers like a glove.\n\nHe grasped at the skin above his pectorals, his scapulas, his trapezius, peeling them off in globs and strips. The pile of blood and gristle grew at his feet as he shredded more and more of himself in a drug-fueled stupor. All the while, he never took his eye off of his new, beautiful face.\n\nHe reached for his kneecaps, but the blood loss caused him to lose his balance and he fell over, breaking his arms in the process. His exposed muscles twitched and flexed like a symphony in red, writhing like a fish out of water, covering the bathroom tile in his slop.\n\nHe was finally perfect, he thought, before the spark went out in his brain forever.",

        "description": "The doctors told him he needed to spend less time sitting down on the toilet, but it was his quiet place. The only place he could hide safely from the outside world and breathe for a minute. Nevertheless,  they gave him some suppositories and instructions. He waited at the bathroom door in the hospital, pounding on it a few times, but to no avail: Some woman was laughing in there. Embarrassment overtook him and he held it all the way until he got back home, stuck in traffic because of some raging house fire a few streets down.\n\nWhen he got inside, he felt around for the light switch, but couldn't grasp it. The only light turned on was in the bathroom, and it illuminated the hallway faintly enough that he could paw his way along the wall to get to it.\n\nHe sat down, blissfully ignorant of the doctor's instructions, and took out his phone. A few minutes passed by in silence as he whisked through all his usual news sites, made a funny tweet, and played a few rounds of Noodles.\n\nThen he noticed his pills were gone.\n\nFrantically, he swiped at every errant towel and cleaning product in the room to see where they could have gone. No shelf or cabinet held them. They just disappeared. He groaned at the thought of having to go back to the pharmacy so soon. Embarrassment seemed to follow him around like a cloud.\n\nA groan came from the pipes, like a metal belly inhaling and exhaling. A chip of paint cracked loose from the wall as the sound travelled closer, closer, snaking around the corners and rumbling upwards. Then it stopped.\n\nFrozen in his seat, the next sound he heard was the clack and clink of long, old fingernails in a ceramic bowl, scraping themselves closer. The next thing he felt was a wet, gnarled finger brush against the skin of his inner thigh.\n\nAs always, it was trying to help.",

        "description": "That night, Jane and Kevin made love, if something so methodical and brief could be considered love. It was one more try to have a baby, in a year of dozens of such attempts. But something was different about it all, when her fiancé finally spent himself. His breath sounded ragged and wet, like something was stuck in the back of his throat. His exhales sounded like inhales, and vice versa. He got up to use the bathroom, and right as the faucet turned on, she swore she could hear that sound again from where she sat on the bed.\n\nThat summer night was so hot, even with every window open and the ceiling fan lazily rocking above, she couldn't bear to lie in the sheets. She slid her feet against Kevin's, whose toes always managed to be cold. Tonight, it was just what she needed, and it helped her drift off to sleep. \n\nA week later, she got the happiest news she could have received: They were going to be parents. Before, they were thinking about moving to a cheaper neighborhood; now, all they could do was pick out colors for the nursery in Kevin's old office. This finally catapulted them into the same phase of their lives as all their friends, who were already raising 2- or 3-year-olds, and the baby showers and get-togethers seemed to crackle with a newfound common ground. Finally, their life was getting back on track.\n\nThe delivery wasn't supposed to happen for another 2 weeks, but Jane's baby was simply impatient to join the world, it seemed. She writhed and thrashed in pain, just like the classes and videos said she would. But to Kevin, her eyes seemed bloodshot, her neck straining with veins he didn't know she had. It didn't seem right, and the doctors told him to go outside. They needed to do a C-section, and the baby wasn't in the right position for it. This would be better handled with him out of the room.\n\nSitting outside was driving him mad. He remembered her book, the one she was reading about becoming a new mother - in their earlier panic to get to the hospital, she left it at home. He could make himself useful and get back in time for the delivery, and she'd have something to read during her stay afterwards. He didn't waste another second, running two red lights just to get home.\n\nA police siren turned on right behind Kevin, freezing him in his seat until the cop car weaved around him to barrel on ahead. By this time, they reached a residential area - what was the cop going for, if not him? And what was that bright light around the corner, on their street?\n\nKevin turned left and saw a raging fire coming from their house, flames towering higher and higher. It swallowed the tree he planned to use for his daughter's treehouse, it took the backyard she and her new puppy would play in. It caved in the roof above the nursery and heated up the front windows until they shattered.\n\nHours later, when the hoses had drowned the last of the flames away and the fire trucks turned to leave, Kevin walked to the center of what was once their home, standing on the still-smoldering ashes. His phone buzzed incessantly in the passenger seat of his car. It was the 10th call in a row he missed, all from the hospital. He couldn't hear it.\n\nHe crouched down closer to a mound of charcoal and ash, clearing some of the debris away. There was a half-melted candle, with pink stripes. Like something for a birthday cake. He remembered those old party candles now, last time he saw them they were shoved in the back of one of those kitchen drawers. They'd gone missing for months.\n\nSomething in the ash took a breath.\n\n---\n\nCome Play with Me by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400042\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nGathering Darkness by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100849\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

Also, I no longer have anyone to guide me, so I welcome death with open arms.\" And with that, he wandered into traffic, missed every single car on the 7-lane freeway, sat down on the other end of the overpass and cried.",

        "description": "They set up a perimeter around the woods. Ever since the Harbinger and his brother went on those rampages years back, no one was taking any chances. Every available officer on the force had every conceivable exit surrounded. Each sweep of flashlight beams, each crunch of twigs underneath their boots, brought them no closer to their mark. He may as well have been gone.\n\nSergeant Patterson's latest sting was a bust. But he was sure he was here. He sent his best men out to secure the rim. Syben. Barter. Goodwin. Ramos. All trustworthy men, and damn good at their jobs. No sign of the man with the gleaming hook.\n\nThey wanted to pack it in. But Patterson knew something wasn't right. This killer was different than the others this town had seen. Even those fitness freaks who tried converting people to their cult a year ago. That was forced assimilation, but they crept around silently. This guy...this guy wanted attention. He wanted a show. And here was his stage. It didn't make sense.\n\nSarge made the call: They were staying the night, taking it in shifts. As they hunkered down for the long stakeout, Patterson put Ramos up as first watch. \n\n\"This guy's late to his own funeral,\" the Sergeant muttered to no one, as if to steel his resolve for his long, final night ahead.",

        "description": "One by one, people were ripped from their homes in the city. Fingernail scratches dotted the tops of doorways, second-story windows were shattered, evidence of women, children and men clutching in vain for dear life. Curiously, despite the shower of glass, wood and blood in each foyer, every bed was made perfectly.\n\nEveryone was brought to a clearing, hovering up above the treeline, suspended in mid-air. Struggling only caused them to spin slowly in place, as if they were impaled by some invisible bar through the abdomen. After the screaming subsided, the chosen ones'  thoughts turned to each other. Inexplicably, the fear they felt as a group started to give way to...jealousy.\n\nSomething snaked in and around their brains, curdling their thoughts into hate. It started with the personal trainer, who noticed a dozen pairs of hollow eyes leering at her with rage. They wanted her body. They wanted it to be taken from her and given to them.\n\nNo one could move to attack her, but as if sensing their thoughts, an invisible force began to drain the life away from her. A straw sucking from the inside, vacuum-sealing her flesh to her ribs, eyes rolling back into her skull, hair dissolving into clumps. She broke in half at the waist before she was even finished, and her bony feet touched the back of her shriveled head as she hung there, lifeless, spinning in the void above the clearing with the rest of the mob.\n\nSmiles stretched across their faces. They could feel it. They could feel the burning inside, the fruits of their mental, hateful labor blossoming within. It felt so good to watch the subcutaneous fat shudder away, shrinking and sucking and withering, revealing taut muscles and slim waists. A peal of laughter caught fire with the group, as their bodies took the shape of dreams - as if the person they wished they were when they looked in the mirror had stepped out of the glass to replace them, mind body and soul.\n\nSlowly they were lowered back to Earth, bare feet feeling the blades of grass. Their legs flexed as they wriggled their toes in the dirt, each one a perfect, and perfectly absent, specimen. They looked up. The trainer, or what was left of her, was still hovering in the sky, a husk dripping the ash of dead flesh like snowflakes. It fell softly around them, but didn't stain their clothes or skin. It slid right off. Nothing could penetrate them now. The master would see to that. Now all they had to do was march.\n\nThe cleansing began.",

        "description": "The child-proof locks on the cabinets were not enough for Jean. She knew the baby could smell the chemicals under the sink, clear across the house from the crib in his room. So they weatherstripped every door and bought an air purifier for the nursery, but that still didn't suffice. Jean heard noises at night, discordant creaks underneath the house as if rats were biting on piano wire. She became obsessed with caulking every crack in the walls, stitching the small gaps in the floorboards tighter and tighter with poorly-drilled screws at awkward, splintering angles. Like the floor, she was winding herself tighter and tighter, a rag doll about to burst at the seams.\n\nHer husband became concerned enough to finally phone her doctor, and as he repeated her behavior into the receiver, he slowly understood what was happening before Dr. Richards could even diagnose it.\n\n\"I would say, Steven, based on what you've just told me, that Jean appears to be suffering from...\"\n\n\"Shhh.\"\n\nSteven didn't care about the diagnosis. He needed silence.\n\n\"Do you hear that, Doctor?\"\n\n\"No, I'm afraid I don't follow...\"\n\nSteven heard it again. The sound of someone else on the line, trying in vain to hold their breath.\n\n\"I'll call you back.\" He hung up and slowly exited the office. \"Jean?\" He said, rounding the corner into the main hallway. \"What did you hear, honey?\"\n\nHe looked cautiously into the nursery as he continued down the hall, each footstep eliciting another creak from the tense, splitting boards. The mobile was spinning softly above the crib, a dolphin, a whale, an octopus with all eight legs snipped off. Choking hazards, she said. The baby wasn't inside.\n\nSteven turned. His pant leg caught on one of the jutting screws, and he tripped to land on his face, the bridge of his nose breaking on contact with a bent nail.\n\nAs he passed out, he saw the shadow of Jean's legs spill across the light leading into the kitchen. He was just in time for dinner.",

        "description": "For Joe, coming home to West Virginia was like being denied his existence. The VA lost his paperwork. The shrink would routinely forget his name, prescribe him bottles of sedatives with names he couldn't pronounce. People he went to high school with didn't look at him as he'd cross the street to the grocery store - and when the produce section's automatic misters turned on, they'd play a cute little \"thunder clap\" sound which sent Joe diving for cover. That, he noticed, got them looking. Looking right at him. He felt strangely grateful for these moments, as they confirmed he wasn't just a ghost haunting a better life he left behind.\n\nEventually, the court ordered that Joe was a danger to his daughter, and could only see her with an appointed psychiatrist in tow, a stern woman named Alice who clearly hated children. Why was he the danger, and not her? Joe loved his daughter, from the moment he held her, to every time he caught her before she could fall off a bike or a swing set. He was her guardian angel, she made him feel whole, like a protector. She made him forget about the door he sent his men through in Kandahar.\n\nHe woke up in bed at the memory of the door, but it dawned on him that he wasn't sleeping either. It took him days to sleep, even after weaning himself off of coffee. Was the entire day a dream, and this the reality?\n\nHis closet door creaked open. It had holes punched in it from when Joe went to a dark place, but now they looked like bullet holes. The moon was so bright, the brown wood looked like it was painted blue. Just like that door in Kandahar.\n\nJoe got up, walked through the door, and never came back.\n\nhttps://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/",

It feels like something inside is crawling underneath, tumors worming out of their attachments to your joints and bones. This, as you discover, is to allow your arms to rotate to a degree and angle previously thought impossible, so that your elbows slot in perfectly into the corners on either side of your head.\n\nYour hair follicles permeate the felt of the box, twisting around the fibers and forming deep attachments. They grow as necessary, like flowers blooming in time-lapse motion, to gain greater purchase as they begin to pull at the skin.\n\nIt's stunning how pliable the flesh is, as it sloughs off the body, almost like a thick puddle of pink syrup, coating the inner walls of the box like a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. Once it pools out, the first thing to go are your lips - helpful, since it prevents you from screaming about what's happening to your kneecaps, your eyes, the strange feeling inside as if your veins are part of a taffy pull.\n\nBefore your brain begins to accommodate the shape of the box, each fold collapsing and warm blood draining out of your drooping sockets to some unseen cavern below the felt, the last thought going through your head is how terribly alone you are. But you mustn't worry. You'll be surrounded by your friends soon enough.",

That made it seem worse somehow, as there was nowhere safe if not a clear open field bathed in the protection of the sun, every dark corner made bright, every secret exposed. Based on the blood splatter analysis, the muddy squick of bloody bootprints, the careless festooning of fingernails, the only secret left seemed to be why the killer was in such a hurry to finish a job that normally took him hours.\n\nRamos left the clearing to follow the final set of tracks from the only victim unaccounted for. They split up, as they often do, he chuckled darkly in his head. Each one only made it as far as the killer’s traps would let them, be it a hanging bear trap that dug into Victim 1’s temples and then kept going, an arrow that pinned Victim 2’s hand to the eye, the eye to the back of the skull, the skull to the bark of a tree, or a trace of poison in the weeds that raised Victim 3’s blood pressure the more he ran, the more he screamed, until the vessels burst and he gurgled his remains face down in the clearing. This set of tracks, however, had promise. This one, Ramos thought in soft admiration, made it far.\n\nFinally, after a trip that took him to the banks of the river - and presumably, the salvation the victim thought he’d receive upon diving in - Ramos saw the end of it all. The tracks, previously four feet apart from each other in a tremendous sprint, ended in a flurry of scattered prints, a kicking of dirt, a struggling.\n\nA drop of fresh blood landed in the middle of the spiral of tracks. Ramos looked up. Razor wire wove around the body like a cocoon, cinching steel wrapping Victim 4 to the sturdy branch of the redwood above, warping his flesh with every struggle. He was still alive.\n\nHelp me, he said to Ramos, with the shreds of tongue he had left brushing against his remaining teeth, just enough air coming out of the mouth instead of the gash in his neck.\n\nOfficer Ramos politely turned and walked away. The rules were, you don’t disturb the scene until the kill is complete. That’s how things were done in this town. And Officer Ramos knew the rules.\n\n“It’s not right - it was supposed to be at night,” Bill told Ramos later that afternoon in exasperated gasps as the Officer donned his hat and entered his vehicle.\n\n“I know. They arrived early. It’s not my job to question how the thing is done.”\n\n“No. He’s been acting different. My brother.”\n\nRamos closed his door, fingers still gripping the handle. He froze in realization. The Harbinger wasn’t telling. He was pleading.\n\n“I wouldn’t be here now if I was you, Officer.”\n\nIndeed, as he saw in his rear view mirror, the sun was setting. Early, at 3:45 PM. Early even for winter.\n\n“I wouldn’t be here now. In the dark.”\n\nOfficer Ramos calmly locked the doors, turned the key in the ignition. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it.",

We even pick his brain about horror movies, and find out what single piece of media he considers more instructive to making cinema than any film school.\n\nIs Mad Max Fury Road a horror movie? No. Is the audio in this interview pretty messed up? Yes, for reasons that are so legion it's impossible to list them all here. Do we get down to talking about some great stuff in this episode anyway? You bet.\n\nThanks to Louie, Chloe and Claire at Warner Brothers for this awesome opportunity, and thanks to Philipp Ammon for shooting it!\n\nFollow Bing: http://youtube.com/slomozovo\nFollow Leena: http://youtube.com/jsutkissmyfrog\nWatch the podcast at Brian & Maria's channel: http://youtube.com/bfirenzi\nListen to the podcast: http://soundcloud.com/5secondfilms\nOr listen on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/is-it-still-scary/id1035171726?mt=2",

The FBI (Feathered Bureau of Investigation) once organized an infamous sting where they substituted Red-Red for cranberry juice and water and used undercover agents to handle a drop-off. The Flapstreet Crew took the whole payload without ever sensing anything was up, mostly because cranberry juice mixed with water is literally Red Red Juice. Hundreds of FBI agents were fired as a result.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ and shot with the LG G4, powered by a Snapdragon processor. \n\nSnapdragon processors support breath-taking speed, jaw-dropping graphics, ultra-fast connectivity and longer battery life so you can do more of what you love.\n\nGet more info on Snapdragon here: http://bit.ly/1EtqfpN\nAnd check out our behind the scenes from the shoot here: http://bit.ly/1JHFnz9",

Nevertheless, he listened to Burzum's prison albums entirely too loud, which his friends' parents found distasteful mostly because dark ambient is overrated and Burzum hasn't been good since '93. They're pretty cool, indeed, but also kinda elitist.",
