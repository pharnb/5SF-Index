    "description": "He seemed cool, calm and collected in the other room, waiting for his coffee (which he was assured was for closers). However, as the dulcet tones of Blake’s hypercapitalist putdowns filled his ears, he felt a warmth in his pants that could only be described as the high-pressure evacuation of bowels that had spent a lifetime damming the riverbed of feces with over-processed meat discs. Indeed, the first shit he had taken in decades finally let loose, and it wasn’t a small handful of struggle nuggets like in the past. No, readers, this was a piping hot surge of the wet brown, an astonishing geyser of human jet fuel that propelled the man through the roof and into the sky, wind whipping at his cheeks, carrying him ever further into the cold recesses of space. As the atmospheric frost stopped his tears dead in their tracks and coagulated over his trembling salmon lips, a final word escaped between them, the last anyone would ever hear: “Patriarchy.”\n\nIf you’re charmed by this fairy tale ending but know that it isn’t remotely true, then you also know there’s tons of work to be done. Finish whatever you’re drinking, enjoy the rest of the day, wake up and then go here to find a list of Georgia organizations that will help get out the vote for the upcoming runoff elections.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ho5HxLJhuWxy1QKzi4_7Ryt6Nvk2wm3RakOgeGiOWK0/edit#gid=0",

Using the energy of the Interdimensional Flux - caused by cloning unthinkable scores of crime-identifying children - we were able to ensnare the chief in his own bones. All right, team, let's roll out to the Taco Bar and round up a few meaty tortillas. Margs on me.\n\nActually team, you can all pile in the Flux Wagon. The new recruit and I are going to ride in my car. If you get there first, you know my usual order.\n\n.\n\nAre they gone? Hmmm. Yes, I see them piling in. Okay rookie, I'm going to tell it to you straight. I wasn't happy with your performance today. I know, it's your job as a newcomer to be seen and not heard, but frankly I didn't see you strut your stuff out there either. Could've used more hustle when it came to cloning the husky sons. And your resume says you have experience in bone entrapment, but Vasquez said you were asking lots of questions about the Fluxer. Lots. Of questions.\n\nOn my team, I need leaders and players. \"Layers,\" I call 'em. They lay the pipe to link up the flow, for end-to-end delivery of chief-trapping product. They fux with the flux, they're locked into the bone zone. And I don't see you laying pipe with my team. Nope, you're not getting tacos with us. In fact you're not allowed to get tacos ever again. Now get out of here before I stuff you into the head closet.",

They are unhappy because they have lost everyone they know to Happy Time Cream. If they did gain access to Happy Time Cream, they would die because they would eat the cream, which you absolutely must not do. We can't fully explain why these terrorists are behaving the way they do, but regardless, their recipes are war crimes and they need to be stopped - perhaps the best way to stop them would be by giving them the Happy Time Cream they so crave, but it's a really brutal way to go and we can't live with ourselves if we did that.

That asshole dog is a goddamn tree.\" Needles thought about this mantra now - about the peace it used to bring him when his sapling head would fill with worries at night - and came to the realization that he was always, in a way, alone in this savage world of paperwork, talk radio and fingernails. He proceeded to weep in the way trees do, when it is time to grieve: By secreting the delicious sap that the sapsucker birds so love to eat. His tears fueled their powerful bodies for days to come until he could cry no more, and, full of holes and regret, he rotted away in that bedroom, dressed in his Christmas finest when the police finally found both of them.",

DLR soon left the band to form his own supergroup where \"all the songs would sound like shit on purpose,\" and Van Halen carried on with Sammy Hagar, known as the Red Rocker because of how much blood often turned up in his stool.",

All Protaks, all fully armored with the highest Rim gear. They would need to be. She was meeting with none other than the battle captain of the One Day Tribe himself, and could leave nothing to chance, no matter what neutral ground he claimed to receive her on.\n\nRenzi Bain, captain of the Blizzard Armada Liberation League, sat calmly in a cold chrome chair in the middle of the massive room. No weapons, no guards. Even his hands were made visible, on his lap. As Mar'del entered the room, she took note of his seeming harmlessness. She sensed a trap, but knew that in order to advance, she would have to respond with a show of good faith - and nodded for her guards to lower their weapons and remain at ease.\n\n\"[I see you spared no expense with your backup dancers there,]\" Growled Renzi in his crude tribal tongue. \"[I'm beginning to get the impression you don't trust me.]\"\n\n\"[And why would that be, I wonder,]\" Volleyed Mar'del, displaying a surprising grasp of Renzi's language. \"[The last time we met, you were bathed in the frost of our cannons on New Saturn. Did you think I wouldn't anticipate a return engagement?]\"\n\nRenzi said nothing. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. Sensing doubt in his own strategy, Mar'del smiled and softened in an attempt to lure him closer to the diplomatic table.\n\n\"Let us speak in the tongue of our ancestors,\" She said. \"It's what they would have wanted, after all this bloodshed.\"\n\n\"How do you know what they would have wanted?\" Renzi grunted, more sweat coalescing on his brow. He almost appeared ill.\n\nMar'del expected this meeting to be more difficult. She looked off into the inky vastness of space outside the massive windows, agreeing. \"It's true, I suppose. So much time has passed. Who can say what was fact or fiction any longer?\" As she pondered that thought, Renzi wiped the sweat off his face, practically pooling in the palms of his hands.\n\n\"How can you be sweating, Renzi? This room is so cold.\"\n\n\"I'm sweating because I took a pill to induce it earlier,\" he muttered under his breath. Then he looked up at her. \"And it IS cold in here, isn't it? Cold enough...to crystallize.\"\n\nHis hands unveiled his masterstroke: A snowball carved entirely from the sweat of his skin. He plunged it deep into her face, spraying her with wet frost, and he atomized out of the room before her guards could respond. The only trace of his presence was the cold liquid on Mar'del's fuming face, and his low chuckle echoing in the distance.\n\nShe stood up, wiping herself clean. The war would continue. It would always continue.",

They stopped walking. Samantha held Glasses Dude's other hand now too, and they looked deep into each others' eyes. Their lips drew closer and closer.\n\nHe watched every inch of their body language with rapt attention. Nothing could rip him away from the screen.\n\nJust then, the video paused at the halfway point to run an ad about Trivago or something dumb. It would be an entire 30 seconds before the video resumed, and Samantha's boyfriend clicked away, disgusted with the state of modern advertising.",

One by one, as the skulls were caved in and the colosseum grew evermore stained with blood, the final two daddies faced off against a surprised opponent: Maury himself, who grew fond of the boy and, with steam emerging from his nostrils as he chuckled haughtily, chose to enter the tournament to lay claim. Neither daddy was a match for Maury's incredibly OP specials, and soon the child was slung over Maury's powerful shoulder, carried off into the darkening horizon of the blood-red sun.",

    "description": "We have several announcements about our Kickstarter! But first, click here if you haven't visited the page already: http://goo.gl/ozvtv\n\nSkip to 3:26 to get right to the comments, but if you do that, why not take some of the time you saved by reading about our Kickstarter announcements right here?\n\n...\n\nPeople looking to get involved with all the slicing and dicing include Patton Oswalt, Andrew WK, Peter Stormare, the guys from BriTANicK, Freddie Wong, TomSka, Beck Bennett, and more to come too! This film is going to be a huge homecoming party for us and all of the awesome people we've met along our five-year career!\n\nOn June 20th, we'll be hosting a four-hour STREAM-A-THON...LIVE! At the YouTube Space in Playa Vista. There'll be great music, rapping from Paul, stand-up comedy, sketches, and boatloads of interactivity, starring us and several surprise guests! Watch from home, or be one of the first 20 people to pledge $60 on our Kickstarter page to receive an exclusive invitation to the event!\n\nPledge $200 (or add onto your pledge to arrive at the $200 level) and you can have your very own 5sf idea become a reality! Pitch us your concept, we'll workshop it with you, produce it and put it on our sites with your name credited!\n\nOne lucky backer has already pledged at the $666 level to receive an exclusive video message from Satan (Ben Gigli)! We promise that if FIVE more people (six total) pledge at this level, we will listen to the fans and finally deliver unto thee...a DEVIL WEEK at 5sf!\n\nAnd if all that isn't enough, we're heading back to Reddit for another AMA, this Tuesday June 4th! We're a big, big group - and our goal is to answer as many questions as humanly possible! Seriously, ask us anything. We're not shy, as you've figured out by now.\n\nFinally, we address some questions about pledging for those without credit cards or those living outside America. Please visit the FAQ on our kickstarter page (http://goo.gl/ozvtv) to see if our answers help!\n\nWe are so thrilled and honored by the kind words and donations you guys have sent our way, it really means everything to us. If you don't have a dollar to spare, believe me, we understand...every little thing helps, including spreading awareness about the project to your friends, your Twitter or your Facebook!\n\nFollow us at http://twitter.com/5sf to stay up-to-date on everything!

Years later, still struggling with the memories of that loss, those boogies reluctantly answered a distress signal from somewhere deep inside the same nose. It appeared a boogie was trapped and needed assistance - but in fact, the boogie was professional criminal John Lithgow, in search of $100 million. There was a boogie battle to the death, and many a plot and character beat were arrived at.",

Eventually, Hey Whatta realized he was meant for more, so he ran away from his billionaire oil magnate owners and enrolled in medical school. It was hard to adjust at first, but eventually he found his way - and a beautiful girl named Christy caught his eye in class. As they hung out more and more, she revealed to Hey Whatta her secret passion for the cello. Hearing her play brought him to tears - it revealed another world of creativity, of exploration and meaning to the gentle steed. Christy's parents eventually caught wind of their friendship and sent her away to another school, but she left behind sheet music of Hey Whatta's favorite piece she played, with a note telling him to never stop chasing what he was looking for, whether it be a medical degree, a chance to play at the London Philharmonic, or a finish line. He took the advice to heart.",

Personally, I think there's virtue in making incredibly constricting, esoteric parodies of boring, award-baiting films that very few people have seen or care about. There's honor in it. There's the vague hope that an entertainment website will blog about our Oscar parodies, even though those will almost certainly not be as good as our other work, but hey, free press. It's worth it. And wheeling out some cute dogs in an attempt to \"jazz up\" the stale proceedings is just cheap pandering. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. Also, I shaved the cat.",

But each lyric, each melody harkens back to a throbbing, still-living memory of his past, and those memories collide, overlap and connect to bring clarity and focus to the shape of his life, just as each part of a symphony comes together in a roiling crescendo of beauty. Also, he fucking hates Ben.",

He laid with the rat in the wall, peering back to see the scratchings of its words. He watched the arms of Mr. Shadows stretch into the bathroom, watched the faint burst of light in the distance wash away the creature's features like an acid bath. He witnessed the stitches and staples threading the flesh of Jerry Klobb, heard Ellen's piercing laughter as she punctured his body. When he was finished, he would delete them from existence with a pitch-black shroud and the words THE END. If he chose to restart their cycle of want and torture, he did so with a press of a button. Their lives hung, and hung, and hung again in the balance of his murderous fingers.\n\nThen, when he was through with destroying and rebooting realities, he closed his browser window and resumed working. He never thought much about these lives after he was done with them. He might show the extent of his cruelty to a friend, and see whether they laughed or not. Perhaps sometimes, he'd leave a comment - a humorous pun, a meme, the phrase \"I Am the Plot Twist Killer\" - but he never, ever, ever cared.\n\nAnd why would he? He's you.",

    "description": "Andrew had a lot of adjusting to do after moving into the house. He never met the guy whose room he would be inheriting, but he sure collected a lot of men's beauty magazines. The other guy was always hogging the bathroom and never had much to say. And then there was Mr. Shadows.\n\nThe rules of the house, which were posted inside Mr. Shadows' water heater closet where he slept, detailed exactly what humans were and weren't. When they were alive, they were not food. When they were dead and rotting, they were food. If the cops arrived before you could eat the body, they weren't food anymore. And human food was for humans.\n\nMr. Shadows would abuse this last rule time and again, like when he crawled into the refrigerator once the lightbulb broke, or when he ordered raw sausage casings on Amazon as \"snacks for everyone.\" The cake was the last straw, something Andrew's girlfriend left for him in anticipation of his birthday tomorrow. Mr. Shadows saw the cake sort of looked like him, and decided to have it all to himself. He even lit the candle, assuming that's just what one does before eating cake. Of course, lighting it from a distance took some work, and the closer he brought his face to the flame, the more his nose disappeared. He tried to be careful about that, but this time he was just too excited.\n\nNow it was all over the floor, ruined. Andrew threw it away and scolded Shadows for going through his cupboard. Then he retired to the living room, where he slept on the couch while Jerry was still in the process of moving out.\n\nThe sound of wet gristle slapping on the floor woke Andrew up later in the evening. He sat upright on the couch, rubbing his eyes. Then he saw Mr. Shadows, staring out the window.\n\nA house was on fire some number of streets down, illuminating everything in its faraway flicker. It was just bright enough that it managed to shine faintly on Mr. Shadows' face, carving the front of his head away from sight. Only the hollow interior of the back of his head was visible, like a broken mannequin inside an empty store. Then it spoke.\n\n\"So many rules,\" he said to Andrew. \"So many little rules.\" He turned to look at the couch and the half of his face furthest from the window returned to view, revealing half of a wide set of incisors bent in a crooked smile.\n\nThey both heard a muddy thud from the bathroom. Like a body falling. Andrew looked in its direction, praying that Shadows would look too. But he just stared at Andrew with his one visible eye.\n\n\"Sleep well,\" he said, before turning the lights on and skittering to the bathroom. Andrew fell asleep to the churning sounds of chewing and slurping, organs vanishing into an unseen dimension, blood wiping itself off the tile with the sound of deep, sensuous licking.\n\nIt was the last peaceful night's sleep Andrew would get.",

    "description": "Ellen had long since been banned from practicing surgery, but they couldn't stop her in time from barricading the men's bathroom door and filling the room with her clothes and soup cans. Police weren't able to make it to the hospital just yet, so until then the staff would have to make sure no one came in or out. It's not like Ellen was capable of much in there anyway.\n\nUntil Jerry stopped by to use the bathroom.\n\nEllen had been screening each potential suitor through a self-made peephole in the door, and finally she found someone knocking on the door who suited her tastes. He just needed a few adjustments.\n\n******\n\nBy the time police finally burst open the door and took Ellen away, Jerry was gone. He stumbled out of the room in a daze, shuffling past his car in the parking lot and onto the long stretch of lonesome road towards home. As his skin loosened around the puncture holes, every step jangled the staples in his face more and more, scraping against the open nerves under his flesh. He couldn't feel it, nor could he care. He was beautiful.\n\nThe blood had congealed over his left eye, shutting it completely. But his right eye could still see through the pinhole of the mask to the outside world, to the mirror in front of him. And what he saw was breathtaking. A bold push-broom mustache, the likes of which he could never grow himself. A strong nose, proud brow. Everything was smooth and pliable. He had achieved his dreams.\n\nIt was a shame, he realized, that the rest of him didn't match up. Everywhere else he looked, he saw the flabby, rough, pale skin of his former self. It sickened him that his old body couldn't live up to the promise of his new face.\n\nHe dug in deep to the skin in the crook of his arm, and pulled. Like wet tissue paper, it sloughed off with a bare squick. He saw the tendons underneath, the beautiful bone. He grabbed more, pulling up his forearm until the flesh inverted around the bones of his fingers like a glove.\n\nHe grasped at the skin above his pectorals, his scapulas, his trapezius, peeling them off in globs and strips. The pile of blood and gristle grew at his feet as he shredded more and more of himself in a drug-fueled stupor. All the while, he never took his eye off of his new, beautiful face.\n\nHe reached for his kneecaps, but the blood loss caused him to lose his balance and he fell over, breaking his arms in the process. His exposed muscles twitched and flexed like a symphony in red, writhing like a fish out of water, covering the bathroom tile in his slop.\n\nHe was finally perfect, he thought, before the spark went out in his brain forever.",

    "description": "The doctors told him he needed to spend less time sitting down on the toilet, but it was his quiet place. The only place he could hide safely from the outside world and breathe for a minute. Nevertheless,  they gave him some suppositories and instructions. He waited at the bathroom door in the hospital, pounding on it a few times, but to no avail: Some woman was laughing in there. Embarrassment overtook him and he held it all the way until he got back home, stuck in traffic because of some raging house fire a few streets down.\n\nWhen he got inside, he felt around for the light switch, but couldn't grasp it. The only light turned on was in the bathroom, and it illuminated the hallway faintly enough that he could paw his way along the wall to get to it.\n\nHe sat down, blissfully ignorant of the doctor's instructions, and took out his phone. A few minutes passed by in silence as he whisked through all his usual news sites, made a funny tweet, and played a few rounds of Noodles.\n\nThen he noticed his pills were gone.\n\nFrantically, he swiped at every errant towel and cleaning product in the room to see where they could have gone. No shelf or cabinet held them. They just disappeared. He groaned at the thought of having to go back to the pharmacy so soon. Embarrassment seemed to follow him around like a cloud.\n\nA groan came from the pipes, like a metal belly inhaling and exhaling. A chip of paint cracked loose from the wall as the sound travelled closer, closer, snaking around the corners and rumbling upwards. Then it stopped.\n\nFrozen in his seat, the next sound he heard was the clack and clink of long, old fingernails in a ceramic bowl, scraping themselves closer. The next thing he felt was a wet, gnarled finger brush against the skin of his inner thigh.\n\nAs always, it was trying to help.",

    "description": "That night, Jane and Kevin made love, if something so methodical and brief could be considered love. It was one more try to have a baby, in a year of dozens of such attempts. But something was different about it all, when her fiancé finally spent himself. His breath sounded ragged and wet, like something was stuck in the back of his throat. His exhales sounded like inhales, and vice versa. He got up to use the bathroom, and right as the faucet turned on, she swore she could hear that sound again from where she sat on the bed.\n\nThat summer night was so hot, even with every window open and the ceiling fan lazily rocking above, she couldn't bear to lie in the sheets. She slid her feet against Kevin's, whose toes always managed to be cold. Tonight, it was just what she needed, and it helped her drift off to sleep. \n\nA week later, she got the happiest news she could have received: They were going to be parents. Before, they were thinking about moving to a cheaper neighborhood; now, all they could do was pick out colors for the nursery in Kevin's old office. This finally catapulted them into the same phase of their lives as all their friends, who were already raising 2- or 3-year-olds, and the baby showers and get-togethers seemed to crackle with a newfound common ground. Finally, their life was getting back on track.\n\nThe delivery wasn't supposed to happen for another 2 weeks, but Jane's baby was simply impatient to join the world, it seemed. She writhed and thrashed in pain, just like the classes and videos said she would. But to Kevin, her eyes seemed bloodshot, her neck straining with veins he didn't know she had. It didn't seem right, and the doctors told him to go outside. They needed to do a C-section, and the baby wasn't in the right position for it. This would be better handled with him out of the room.\n\nSitting outside was driving him mad. He remembered her book, the one she was reading about becoming a new mother - in their earlier panic to get to the hospital, she left it at home. He could make himself useful and get back in time for the delivery, and she'd have something to read during her stay afterwards. He didn't waste another second, running two red lights just to get home.\n\nA police siren turned on right behind Kevin, freezing him in his seat until the cop car weaved around him to barrel on ahead. By this time, they reached a residential area - what was the cop going for, if not him? And what was that bright light around the corner, on their street?\n\nKevin turned left and saw a raging fire coming from their house, flames towering higher and higher. It swallowed the tree he planned to use for his daughter's treehouse, it took the backyard she and her new puppy would play in. It caved in the roof above the nursery and heated up the front windows until they shattered.\n\nHours later, when the hoses had drowned the last of the flames away and the fire trucks turned to leave, Kevin walked to the center of what was once their home, standing on the still-smoldering ashes. His phone buzzed incessantly in the passenger seat of his car. It was the 10th call in a row he missed, all from the hospital. He couldn't hear it.\n\nHe crouched down closer to a mound of charcoal and ash, clearing some of the debris away. There was a half-melted candle, with pink stripes. Like something for a birthday cake. He remembered those old party candles now, last time he saw them they were shoved in the back of one of those kitchen drawers. They'd gone missing for months.\n\nSomething in the ash took a breath.\n\n---\n\nCome Play with Me by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400042\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nGathering Darkness by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100849\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

Also, I no longer have anyone to guide me, so I welcome death with open arms.\" And with that, he wandered into traffic, missed every single car on the 7-lane freeway, sat down on the other end of the overpass and cried.",

Every available officer on the force had every conceivable exit surrounded. Each sweep of flashlight beams, each crunch of twigs underneath their boots, brought them no closer to their mark. He may as well have been gone.\n\nSergeant Patterson's latest sting was a bust. But he was sure he was here. He sent his best men out to secure the rim. Syben. Barter. Goodwin. Ramos. All trustworthy men, and damn good at their jobs. No sign of the man with the gleaming hook.\n\nThey wanted to pack it in. But Patterson knew something wasn't right. This killer was different than the others this town had seen. Even those fitness freaks who tried converting people to their cult a year ago. That was forced assimilation, but they crept around silently. This guy...this guy wanted attention. He wanted a show. And here was his stage. It didn't make sense.\n\nSarge made the call: They were staying the night, taking it in shifts. As they hunkered down for the long stakeout, Patterson put Ramos up as first watch. \n\n\"This guy's late to his own funeral,\" the Sergeant muttered to no one, as if to steel his resolve for his long, final night ahead.",

    "description": "One by one, people were ripped from their homes in the city. Fingernail scratches dotted the tops of doorways, second-story windows were shattered, evidence of women, children and men clutching in vain for dear life. Curiously, despite the shower of glass, wood and blood in each foyer, every bed was made perfectly.\n\nEveryone was brought to a clearing, hovering up above the treeline, suspended in mid-air. Struggling only caused them to spin slowly in place, as if they were impaled by some invisible bar through the abdomen. After the screaming subsided, the chosen ones'  thoughts turned to each other. Inexplicably, the fear they felt as a group started to give way to...jealousy.\n\nSomething snaked in and around their brains, curdling their thoughts into hate. It started with the personal trainer, who noticed a dozen pairs of hollow eyes leering at her with rage. They wanted her body. They wanted it to be taken from her and given to them.\n\nNo one could move to attack her, but as if sensing their thoughts, an invisible force began to drain the life away from her. A straw sucking from the inside, vacuum-sealing her flesh to her ribs, eyes rolling back into her skull, hair dissolving into clumps. She broke in half at the waist before she was even finished, and her bony feet touched the back of her shriveled head as she hung there, lifeless, spinning in the void above the clearing with the rest of the mob.\n\nSmiles stretched across their faces. They could feel it. They could feel the burning inside, the fruits of their mental, hateful labor blossoming within. It felt so good to watch the subcutaneous fat shudder away, shrinking and sucking and withering, revealing taut muscles and slim waists. A peal of laughter caught fire with the group, as their bodies took the shape of dreams - as if the person they wished they were when they looked in the mirror had stepped out of the glass to replace them, mind body and soul.\n\nSlowly they were lowered back to Earth, bare feet feeling the blades of grass. Their legs flexed as they wriggled their toes in the dirt, each one a perfect, and perfectly absent, specimen. They looked up. The trainer, or what was left of her, was still hovering in the sky, a husk dripping the ash of dead flesh like snowflakes. It fell softly around them, but didn't stain their clothes or skin. It slid right off. Nothing could penetrate them now. The master would see to that. Now all they had to do was march.\n\nThe cleansing began.",

    "description": "The child-proof locks on the cabinets were not enough for Jean. She knew the baby could smell the chemicals under the sink, clear across the house from the crib in his room. So they weatherstripped every door and bought an air purifier for the nursery, but that still didn't suffice. Jean heard noises at night, discordant creaks underneath the house as if rats were biting on piano wire. She became obsessed with caulking every crack in the walls, stitching the small gaps in the floorboards tighter and tighter with poorly-drilled screws at awkward, splintering angles. Like the floor, she was winding herself tighter and tighter, a rag doll about to burst at the seams.\n\nHer husband became concerned enough to finally phone her doctor, and as he repeated her behavior into the receiver, he slowly understood what was happening before Dr. Richards could even diagnose it.\n\n\"I would say, Steven, based on what you've just told me, that Jean appears to be suffering from...\"\n\n\"Shhh.\"\n\nSteven didn't care about the diagnosis. He needed silence.\n\n\"Do you hear that, Doctor?\"\n\n\"No, I'm afraid I don't follow...\"\n\nSteven heard it again. The sound of someone else on the line, trying in vain to hold their breath.\n\n\"I'll call you back.\" He hung up and slowly exited the office. \"Jean?\" He said, rounding the corner into the main hallway. \"What did you hear, honey?\"\n\nHe looked cautiously into the nursery as he continued down the hall, each footstep eliciting another creak from the tense, splitting boards. The mobile was spinning softly above the crib, a dolphin, a whale, an octopus with all eight legs snipped off. Choking hazards, she said. The baby wasn't inside.\n\nSteven turned. His pant leg caught on one of the jutting screws, and he tripped to land on his face, the bridge of his nose breaking on contact with a bent nail.\n\nAs he passed out, he saw the shadow of Jean's legs spill across the light leading into the kitchen. He was just in time for dinner.",

    "description": "For Joe, coming home to West Virginia was like being denied his existence. The VA lost his paperwork. The shrink would routinely forget his name, prescribe him bottles of sedatives with names he couldn't pronounce. People he went to high school with didn't look at him as he'd cross the street to the grocery store - and when the produce section's automatic misters turned on, they'd play a cute little \"thunder clap\" sound which sent Joe diving for cover. That, he noticed, got them looking. Looking right at him. He felt strangely grateful for these moments, as they confirmed he wasn't just a ghost haunting a better life he left behind.\n\nEventually, the court ordered that Joe was a danger to his daughter, and could only see her with an appointed psychiatrist in tow, a stern woman named Alice who clearly hated children. Why was he the danger, and not her? Joe loved his daughter, from the moment he held her, to every time he caught her before she could fall off a bike or a swing set. He was her guardian angel, she made him feel whole, like a protector. She made him forget about the door he sent his men through in Kandahar.\n\nHe woke up in bed at the memory of the door, but it dawned on him that he wasn't sleeping either. It took him days to sleep, even after weaning himself off of coffee. Was the entire day a dream, and this the reality?\n\nHis closet door creaked open. It had holes punched in it from when Joe went to a dark place, but now they looked like bullet holes. The moon was so bright, the brown wood looked like it was painted blue. Just like that door in Kandahar.\n\nJoe got up, walked through the door, and never came back.\n\nhttps://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/",

    "description": "It starts with the shoulder muscles. Like tectonic plates shifting, the deltoids slithering under the trapezius to slowly migrate up near the neck. It feels like something inside is crawling underneath, tumors worming out of their attachments to your joints and bones. This, as you discover, is to allow your arms to rotate to a degree and angle previously thought impossible, so that your elbows slot in perfectly into the corners on either side of your head.\n\nYour hair follicles permeate the felt of the box, twisting around the fibers and forming deep attachments. They grow as necessary, like flowers blooming in time-lapse motion, to gain greater purchase as they begin to pull at the skin.\n\nIt's stunning how pliable the flesh is, as it sloughs off the body, almost like a thick puddle of pink syrup, coating the inner walls of the box like a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. Once it pools out, the first thing to go are your lips - helpful, since it prevents you from screaming about what's happening to your kneecaps, your eyes, the strange feeling inside as if your veins are part of a taffy pull.\n\nBefore your brain begins to accommodate the shape of the box, each fold collapsing and warm blood draining out of your drooping sockets to some unseen cavern below the felt, the last thought going through your head is how terribly alone you are. But you mustn't worry. You'll be surrounded by your friends soon enough.",

    "description": "Curiously, Officer Ramos noted in his report, it all happened in broad daylight. That made it seem worse somehow, as there was nowhere safe if not a clear open field bathed in the protection of the sun, every dark corner made bright, every secret exposed. Based on the blood splatter analysis, the muddy squick of bloody bootprints, the careless festooning of fingernails, the only secret left seemed to be why the killer was in such a hurry to finish a job that normally took him hours.\n\nRamos left the clearing to follow the final set of tracks from the only victim unaccounted for. They split up, as they often do, he chuckled darkly in his head. Each one only made it as far as the killer’s traps would let them, be it a hanging bear trap that dug into Victim 1’s temples and then kept going, an arrow that pinned Victim 2’s hand to the eye, the eye to the back of the skull, the skull to the bark of a tree, or a trace of poison in the weeds that raised Victim 3’s blood pressure the more he ran, the more he screamed, until the vessels burst and he gurgled his remains face down in the clearing. This set of tracks, however, had promise. This one, Ramos thought in soft admiration, made it far.\n\nFinally, after a trip that took him to the banks of the river - and presumably, the salvation the victim thought he’d receive upon diving in - Ramos saw the end of it all. The tracks, previously four feet apart from each other in a tremendous sprint, ended in a flurry of scattered prints, a kicking of dirt, a struggling.\n\nA drop of fresh blood landed in the middle of the spiral of tracks. Ramos looked up. Razor wire wove around the body like a cocoon, cinching steel wrapping Victim 4 to the sturdy branch of the redwood above, warping his flesh with every struggle. He was still alive.\n\nHelp me, he said to Ramos, with the shreds of tongue he had left brushing against his remaining teeth, just enough air coming out of the mouth instead of the gash in his neck.\n\nOfficer Ramos politely turned and walked away. The rules were, you don’t disturb the scene until the kill is complete. That’s how things were done in this town. And Officer Ramos knew the rules.\n\n“It’s not right - it was supposed to be at night,” Bill told Ramos later that afternoon in exasperated gasps as the Officer donned his hat and entered his vehicle.\n\n“I know. They arrived early. It’s not my job to question how the thing is done.”\n\n“No. He’s been acting different. My brother.”\n\nRamos closed his door, fingers still gripping the handle. He froze in realization. The Harbinger wasn’t telling. He was pleading.\n\n“I wouldn’t be here now if I was you, Officer.”\n\nIndeed, as he saw in his rear view mirror, the sun was setting. Early, at 3:45 PM. Early even for winter.\n\n“I wouldn’t be here now. In the dark.”\n\nOfficer Ramos calmly locked the doors, turned the key in the ignition. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it. And turned it.",

Those road trips across the country would have to wait. Those plans would have to be put up on the brand new Crate & Barrel shelves. Those dreams would have to wither and die, like the mint plants he absent-mindedly bought at Trader Joe's for mojito mixers that never formalized due to friends being unable to find a sitter. The only project he'd complete would be telling other people about the projects he was going to complete. As the years dragged on and the deck became more in need of a staining that would never come, the only loop left for him to close was his timely, average, Facebookable death. A blue-bordered slice of oblivion, tucked nicely into a news feed, which garnered 35 likes and one comment that was a picture of Kevin Hart eating popcorn with the words \"I'm just here for the comments.",

Cynthia led a life of love, laughter and complete satisfaction, and she moved on quietly with, in her final words, absolutely no regrets, at all, not even in the slightest. Proceeds from her dynamite hubbys calendar will go toward a charity started up in her name, the Cynthia Gotaway Charity for Being Incredibly Beautiful, Kind-Hearted and Unattainable.\nStay tuned for Halloween week!",

Some of your co-workers, who shall remain anonymous, have filed several complaints that you're proving to be a disruption at work. Is there any particular reason you scream \"Uhh\" at the top of your lungs for the duration of your time at work each day? If you're confused about your action items, there are procedures for dealing with that as we discussed at last week's staff meeting. There's no need to be disruptive by voicing your confusion for 8 hours straight. Please see me tomorrow.\n\nThanks,\n\nChaz",

While there, Bostwick chews out a beautiful homeless girl (Kristy Swanson) for asking him if he wanted to pet her hairless cat. However, they soon strike an unpredictable friendship, and when Bostwick finds himself back in the lap of luxury, he cant get Swanson out of his head. But being in the public eye after the scandal, can he afford to be seen with a girl who does yoga in the dumpster? Featuring a soundtrack by The Tubes.",

Also, I guess we had to include a mirror or something. Many consider this 5secondfilms crowning achievement, for The Brilliant Dr. Eye alone, and Im not in a real position to say otherwise, since its the only reason we could have possibly won Best Picture and Audience Choice come awards night.

Brian, still in his graduation gown, is shown in his dorm room (which contains various amusing props). He has either hanged himself, or shot himself (whichever is easier to set up). A cardboard sign around his neck says, \"\"FUCK LIFE.\"\"\n_\n\nThe end.",

So when @Bud Light asked us what \"Up For Whatever\" might mean to us, we had an answer instantly: The 5SF House, our unassuming nexus of creativity, a place possessed with an eerie ability to gather us under one roof and inspire us to create our weirdest, craziest jokes.

The steaks are getting to high\" and then you see 2 T-bones smoking a joint, they take a puff and say \"Oh no, don't mind us, we're cool bro...\"  You're free to change any part of this idea, the lines, the setting, whatever. My suggestion basically is just the play on words on \"Stake/Steak\", and \"High\" of course. If you like the poker/gambling thing you could change the ending by making the steaks really irritated by something a stoner would care about, and call off the game. It's up to you, I'm sure you can make the best of it all... Best wishes :D",

I don't know if it is a bad-enough pun, but I came up with this:\n\nTwo people are watching wrestling on the TV sitting on a couch, clearly excited. Then, another one (Subject-C) enters the room and mock them saying: \"Are you watching wrestling? What a marks, men!\" Immediately after saying it, we would change to a close up of the face of Subject-C in which two red dots appear between his eyebrows and he tries to look at the dots astonished. Then we switch to the first two people that are now holding rifles (maybe with the clothes changed now, too) as if they were marksmen (got it? :D) and they say a punchline (I can't come up with anything better than \"you can bet on it\".

I approach the edge of the stage and my father cries, knowing his son is a failure, when I open my mouth and a fully-formed sandwich comes gurgling out.\n\nIt falls into my hands. It's a turkey sandwich with 1 slice of ham for good measure, and ripe cherry tomatoes sliced in half. The lettuce is still wet from being washed, as crisp as the toasted ciabatta bun. The audience is nonplussed, arms folded. They know I don't know my lines. This is not what they paid for.\n\nA cough from the back, signifying nothing. Sometimes it's my mother coughing, other times it's a full-grown bear.\n\nI bring the sandwich to my mouth and begin to take a bite, completely at a loss of what else to do. The crowd erupts in groans of \"Oh come ON\" and \"Of course he'd eat the fucking sandwich\" and \"GET OFF THE STAGE.\" Boos threaten to usurp the student union. And I'm just crying there, mulling the turkey and ciabatta in my mouth.

After he crash-landed the plane, Santa came under inquiry from the courts who deemed him unfit to fly, much like the 2012 movie Flight, directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by John Gatins, starring Denzel Washington and Nadine Velazquez, the plot of which concerns an airline pilot saving almost all his passengers on his malfunctioning airliner which eventually crashed, but an investigation into the accident reveals something troubling.\n\nMerry Christmas and happy IMDB, everyone!",

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and so it goes that once the mind becomes conditioned to the whipping and the piercing and the scouring, once it comes to crave it, so pleasure thus turns into pain. Soon, the simplest things, such as breathing, feel like you're inhaling glass dust; every swallow, every thrum of the adam's apple, feels like a rock is trapped in your throat, pressing into the glottis and threatening to burst. Even blinking, you can feel your eyelashes threading and splitting again like rows of sharp knives. Soon, the sensation of mites digging and nesting into your eyebrows gives way to a spread of imaginary maggots on your forearms, a hallucination that only be beaten back with more cuts, more whips, more chains. It's a virus that consumes the mind first and travels on to the flesh.\n\nAfter the last deep slash was made on the last untouched vein, their pounding heads drenching the pillows with vile blood, they knew they were damned to circle the endless drain into the afterlife. But it didn't matter. An eternal prison in the attic meant nothing, so long as they were finally set free from the chamber of skin.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

Hopefully she wouldn't be here while he came to collect his things, and there was a good chance of that - friends said they had seen her around the docks a while ago, but his boat was still there. Probably selling it, he mused darkly as he made his way through the front door. What's that old saying? The best two days you have as a boat owner are the day you buy it and the day you sell it. His wry smile turned into a chuckle.\n\nAs his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the house, he felt a headache begin its initial throbbing. He reached out to the bookcase to steady himself, but to his eyes, his arms suddenly looked like they stretched 7 feet out from in front of him, and they still missed the shelf.\n\n\"Honey---Pam?!\" He choked out, failing to catch himself from using the baby talk that had come as second nature to him for so many years. His neck burned and his eyes couldn't focus. He heard singing coming from the kitchen, and like a child learning to ice skate, he hugged the wall as he shuffled one foot in front of the next to get there.\n\nHe rounded the corner of the open door to find Pam lying down with her head turned to the side on the black-and-white tile, her arms bound to her sides with rope. She wasn't breathing.\n\n\"Hope you like your steak medium rare, Miles,\" his TA said, turning around holding a pan that sizzled with olive oil. \"You know how much you preferred my cooking to hers.\"\n\nThe last thing he saw as his head hit the floor was the vacant stare in his wife's dead eyes, looking straight through him with hollow irises. And the last thing he heard was the sound of an electric knife whirring on.",

She predicted the skin sloughing off the infected, the camps within the camps, disembodied hands clinging to orange plastic fences while crops burned in the distance.\n\nShe warned of the madness that would consume the country. Fathers caving in their sons' skulls with rocks, wives tying husbands to their beds in a burning house, dogs roving in packs from house to house, indistinguishable from the furious mobs that looted the homes and businesses. Her own husband, opening his mouth to her in the kitchen to say \"What's wrong with me,\" a faint glimpse of his liver rising up from the back of his throat before his insides evacuated completely.\n\nThe last thing she could see, before she became too scared to keep her eyes closed, was a missile rearing its head to face the sun, rising like a new species set to claim the Earth for itself.\n\nThey all laughed at her.

    "description": "Contrary to the old way of thinking, dogs don't see in black-and-white. Our research has shown that they're limited to gradients of yellow and blue. Or so we think. Because there are colors humans can't see either, pigments that have no precedent, and when it's filtered through our pitiful little world of red, blue and green, we can't even distinguish the hand reaching out to us from the wallpaper, the tongue slithering back down the toilet drain when we open the lid, the tendrils curling around our hearts in the passenger seat of the car, ready to tear it out at moment's notice. Our brains don't just choose not to process the colors - they choose not to accept that a dimension of chaos, living in tandem with ours, even exists.\n\nSo when we analyze what a dog can see, just looking at the raw data, we're only getting half the story, looking at their eyes through our own. We can't look at this image and see what they see.\n\nhttp://public.media.smithsonianmag.com/legacy_blog/rainbow-2.jpg\n\nNow if I told you what was staring back at you from that image, just inches from your face, you wouldn't believe me.

    "description": "The good doctor lost his parents in a car accident when he was 11. His sister was slashed to death the following winter when she fell down in a busy ice skating pond. Since that fateful time, he dedicated himself to the work of replicating life, taking back what was stolen from him. Without love or friendship to distract him, his advancements in the field of cloning surpassed what anyone else would have been capable of dreaming of for another 100 years. Blastocysts dissolved, cells were extracted, failure mounting on top of failure, and yet just as quickly the discoveries and solutions kept coming, science seemingly merging with fiction to unlock the next door in a maze of unvisited hallways. Soon the tendrils of a nervous system found their coating in a mulch of skin, wrapping, forming limbs that could kick, thumbs that could curl. As the scalpel carved away the muck between his first fetus’ trembling head and the petri dish, Phase 2 of his work began. Inoculation.\n\nHe began to invite strangers into his home, daring them to guess the secrets of his incredible findings, letting them scoff and deride his accomplishments as parlor tricks. All the while, he used their cynicism as fodder to keep his likenesses inside, beating it into their heads that the world outside hated and denied them, that he was their only friend, their father, their brother, their Good Doctor. For lack of a frame of reference - there was no TV, and no books in the library but those devoted to science - they had no choice but to obey.\n\nFrom there, the years dragged on, and the clones began to show signs of fatigue. Bloodshot eyes and coughing, constant coughing from every corner of the house. But the Doctor was not In. It was winter, and the pond outside the window had frozen over again. He stared unblinking out the window, more preoccupied with a little girl’s laugh he thought he heard than the coughing and moaning all around him. Until a hand gripped his shoulder.\n\n“What have you done, boy?”\n\nThe doctor turned to see an older, taller man with his face, charred from some horrible burn, blood caked on his ears and down his chest, body covered in black tire tracks, shuffling towards him. Next to him, another clone in a pink dress and pearls, with his jaw snapped off, moaned and dragged closer and closer.\n\n“What have you done to us?”\n\nThe Doctor bumped up against the window when a pair of ice-cold hands burst through the glass to grab him. They belonged to another clone, wracked with 8-inch-long gashes across his forehead, throat and eyes. He whispered in the Doctor’s ear:\n\n“You will always be alone.”\n\nWhen the Doctor came screaming to, he was soaked in sweat on the couch by himself. Not a creak in the floorboards to be heard, no coughing, no broken window, no one to just the crackling of the fireplace and a soft rustle of his unfinished papers. He sipped his coffee and, with a heavy sigh, he took the papers to his study. There was work to be done.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

    "description": "Alistair Preston never appeared to her in the flesh again, in the years that followed. Sometimes she’d catch a reflection in the glass as a door closed shut, other times in the gleaming polished lancewood of a passing coach, but in the split second she saw him, all she could make out was the suit he was buried in, with beams of light blooming from the collar and cuffs. In the Christmas of 1899, the same year she donated her husband’s vast coal fortune to the church and moved in with her sister in San Jacinto, she felt a discordance spreading beneath her feet, like her nerves were violin strings being harshly bowed. Sitting in the kitchen looking into her tea, she saw a ripple trembling outward, and fleetingly glimpsed a hand in the reflection, reaching for her, about to crack the surface of the thin green liquid.\n\nThe crucifix hanging in the foyer shook loose, and as it touched the ground, the earth split open, swallowing the cross, a bearskin rug, a bookshelf, and more every passing second. The knife block in the kitchen tipped over, sending knives spinning up and down the linoleum floor as the house rocked one way, then the other. She hid behind a chair as the roof caved in, the knives sliding past her feet, the candles catching the Christmas holly on fire. She screamed for her sister but didn’t dare move to the drawing room to be with her. As she would soon discover when the earthquake subsided and she stumbled there, it was a wise move. The crossbeams had splintered above, keened down and impaled her sister through the chest, pinning her to the center of the room in a kneeling position, leaking red.\n\nShe nursed a cut on her foot, stained in tea, and wailed up the stairs to the bathroom, which hissed with steam. When she flung open the door, she was astonished to see it was the only room completely untouched in the earthquake. Pristine, even. The other thing that was curious: The sink was filling up with hot water, and just as the water was about to crest over the edge and spill onto the floor, it shut itself off.\n\nShe choked back a sob and slowly limped towards the sink, the long thin mirror dulling her reflection with a thick coat of steam. Gripping the sides of the sink, she knew what had to be done. She pulled her hair back, clenched her teeth, and bent over, dipping her face in.\n\nWhen she adjusted to the heat, she opened her eyes, to find Alistair staring inches from her face. Everything else was darkness.\n\n“Hello, Dear,” he said without moving his lips. “Open your mouth. Let me show you what I found down there amongst the coal.”\n\nFiremen arrived on the scene hours later to the shattered house on the hill, seeing for the first and last time in their lives the sight of a woman drowned whilst standing up. It took the strength of three of them to pull her body from the sink, and when they fell backwards with her frozen body, her face looked like she was at peace, like she had seen something beautiful in the water.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

    "description": "Without the musical genius of The Great Contini, Susan would have never had a singing career. indeed, she would have had nothing - born a girl from the streets, she would as surely have left a damp corpse on those same cobblestones if Contini hadn’t found her singing near a brothel some years back. And in the early going with him, life was easy. The parties, the dresses, the champagne. The champagne.\n\nThe broken champagne glasses. The way he’d slap her in full view of the party, sending her upstairs for her insubordinate behavior. The laughs that echoed up the staircase as he no doubt told some boozy joke to sweep all the ugliness under the rug for their friends. And the way he’d sweet talk her after everyone left, a little-boy’s lilt that oozed conciliation. “You keep me together, Susan,” he’d insist, crocodile tears rolling down his cheeks, using his favored metaphor for her. “You’re my glue.”\n\nYes, in a way, Susan felt she owed her life to him, which would explain the lack of struggle she gave when he wrapped his hands around her throat one week ago. Were he not bleary and blinded with drunken rage, Contini would have thought it odd that her eyes looked so calm even as air seemed to trickle from every pore and duct in her face, like a balloon deflating ever so slightly. Better here than on the streets, he thought to himself with a snicker as he dragged her body into the closet under the stairs.\n\nThe afterlife posed many problems for Susan. Rooms she couldn’t escape, darkness she couldn’t penetrate, people she couldn’t communicate with. There was only this mansion, there was only Contini. And whilst one of them was still living, there was composing to be done. And so the hours beat on, a crumpled page here, a shattered tumbler there. And always, always the pounding of those fists on the keys. But one day, Susan no longer cared if what she did next sent her to Heaven or to Hell. Anything would be better than this house.\n\n“Dammit Susan, for the 50th time-” he bellowed, fists coming down hard on the organ, rattling his glass of scotch. Only this time, his fists didn’t come up to point fingers, or take a swig, or slap the sheet music off the stand. They remained rigid, shaking, stuck to the keys.\n\nHis joints hardened, seemingly crystallizing, elbows bolting themselves to his ribs, blood beginning to trickle from his clenched fingers piercing the pads of his jittering, unmovable hands. Contini tried standing, but the force of his legs pushing against his frozen arms succeeded only in snapping the bone clean off, so that his forearms seemed to bend backwards like a mantis. A roar of pain escaped his mouth as he collapsed forward onto the organ. His cheek became affixed to the cherry wood of the organ, slurring his screams as every twist and exertion seemed to fasten him to the instrument more and more. His ear, his neck, his chest, every part of him crumpled and folded into the body of his most prized possession, the screams merging with the ever-present drone of the sour notes his bleeding fists continued to pound on. It was hard to tell which body was making which sound.\n\nSusan walked over to Contini, or what was still left of him, as his skin began to fracture his bones, then shatter them, then pull them closer and closer into the organ, like a porcelain doll being crushed under an invisible foot. One bugged eye, threatening to pop loose from a quivering, stretching socket, stared at her in fear, the last emotion he could muster before he became nothing but a pile of clothes.\n\n“You always said I was your glue, darling,” she growled.\n\nHis life force subsumed entirely into the organ, the horrendous dirge of notes giving way to a geyser of blood fountaining from the pipes above, coating the ceiling in a shade of crimson and dripping down his sheet music. It was The Great Contini’s final piece - and some would say his most satisfying.\n\nThis video was shot at the YouTube Space House of Horrors with @Legendary Entertainment\n#HouseOfHorrors\n#YouTubeSpaceLA\n@legendary",

    "description": "The Fire Island Players Present: 5-Second Films (Ed Wood 2007)The year after our \"Slippery When Wet\" entry in the annual 24-hour filmmaking competition at USC (\"5 Seconds of Slip\"), we stepped it up and brought our B-minus game with a deeper crew, two cameras and luckily a better prompt: \"My Eyes Are Killing Me.\" Also, I guess we had to include a mirror or something. Many consider this 5secondfilms' crowning achievement, for The Brilliant Dr. Eye alone, and I'm not in a real position to say otherwise, since it's the only reason we could have possibly won Best Picture and Audience Choice come awards night. Many thanks to all who participated, the cookies were delicious and the Night Train was pungent.",

Yes, this would be the premium location for tranquility and thoughtful reflection...perhaps, even, for pondering what sandwich he would eat next.

Green Hippo laughed grimly, a small glimmer of hope flickering as fast and intangibly as the billowing flame before them. Then the true Hungry Hungry Hunger set in.",

    "description": "This year for Bummer Week, we wanted to eschew films that were darkly humorous in favor of more serious subjects, in some cases creating 5-second films that may have upset you or at least bummed you out far more than you would have cared to be when visiting our silly humor site. Many short stories were discussed, and one was left on the cutting room floor for fear that we may have overstepped our boundaries in trying to depict such a horrific act. No, it wasn't the \"R\" word.\n\nWhat we're saying is, we want you to know that while we relish the chance to try different things with this format, we didn't take sadistic pleasure in filming or cutting these. Our site is extremely irreverent most of the time, and we think that's the right tack to take with comedy - but thank you for your patience as we dipped our toes into different waters this last week, one last time. Back to your regularly scheduled goofiness - oh, and by the way, we've got some really great stuff coming up.",

No smile escaped her lips, no matter how many times her father played peekaboo with her. Her parents didn't know who to call or what to say - that their baby seemed somehow less alive?\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, Angela was always distraught over something, usually at night, and Nick was there to comfort her, to tell her it would all be okay once the baby came. But tonight, as she gripped her pillow and burned a hole through the far wall with her gaze, Nick could tell she wasn't distraught. Just distant. None of his usual words worked on her. She got up to leave, his hand brushing against her silky nightgown in a futile attempt to keep her there. As she softly closed the door behind her, he sat up with frustration. And noticed Louisa's stuffed bunny rabbit sitting in the corner of the bedroom.\n\nAngela walked down the stairs, heels scraping against the inlaid carpet and fingertips lightly grazing the banister. She stared straight ahead, never once looking at where her feet were going. Instead her eyes remained fixed on the stained glass window hanging above the front door, beaming in red moonlight that canvassed the whole foyer in crimson. It was the last image she was ever conscious for, as the tumble down the stairs made short work of her neck, leaving her body splayed across the cold tile with nothing but the blood moon to blanket her and her gnarled fingers. If anyone was there to witness it, they would have been astonished at how little noise she made.\n\nNick sat at the edge of the bed, holding the stuffed rabbit in his hands. It had a missing button eye, a floppy ear and a strand of red thread hanging from its nose. Vile hand-me-downs from Angela's parents, he thought to himself. As he stood up to go console her, he felt a blade slash his achilles tendons, like violin strings violently plucked. He collapsed to the floor, bellowing with pain, trying to clutch the backs of his ankles but finding it impossible to summon the strength. Blood pooled outward, soaking the bunny he dropped to its side.\n\nLouisa crawled from under the bed, something she hadn't even been able to do before, with a speed and purpose that made it seem as though she was being puppeteered. Her fingers, which once gently grabbed his hands as he played with her, were now clenched around a whittling knife from his garage.\n\nSix seconds later, the screaming stopped.",

    "description": "His fingers unwillingly gripped the edge of the table, as if he had magnets in his fingertips. With every bone in his body, he tugged and pulled and screamed for help as the knife came closer, sharper, closer, sharper. One last big push with his feet sent him away, tumbling, falling, and eventually crashing into the ceiling.\n\nHe opened his eyes, woozy. The ceiling fan blades whipped past, just centimeters below his face. The bed, his teddy bear, his mother's favorite rug, all remained glued to the floor above - with a bright light shining ever brighter from under the bed. He rolled away and hobbled to his feet, with a sprained ankle that he couldn't begin to cry about now.\n\nThe sharpening of steel still pinging in his ears, he hurdled over the archways of doors and dodged flickering ceiling lamps to find his parents. \"Oh, Kevin. What are you up to now?\" He heard, words his mom said all the time, but now in the most unnatural, programmatic tone. She looked down at him from the kitchen floor, washing a perfectly clean dish with a dry sponge. \"Come now, honey. Dinner's ready. Your father's waiting.\"\n\nHe tripped from walking backwards, hitting his head on the living room ceiling. Adrenaline surging, he picked himself up and ran towards the front door, hanging above him like a portal to nowhere. As he jumped for the doorknob, just barely out of his reach, tears began to stream down his face. Was that really his dad under the bed? He looked almost like him...\n\nNoticing the smoke detector to his left, he stepped on it and pushed off with everything he had, setting it off in the process. A deafening siren trilled through the house, almost drowning out the scraping of the knives. He climbed out onto the awning of the porch, landing with a hard thud on the support beams, and crawled to the edge.\n\nFrom the doorway, he saw his mother caked in red and black skin. Her eyes were ice blue. She held her thumb down on an electric whisk, cradling a mixing bowl. Like her, nothing was inside.\n\n\"Where are you going? Dinner's ready.\"\n\nKevin stepped into the night sky, so full of stars.",

She never socialized much with the people there, or the other tenants in her building. And until the police stopped by on a routine call to question the neighbors, no one picked up on the faint scratching that had seemed to be reverberating through the walls, like the sound of a broken doll being stitched together.\n\nKicking in the door proved as futile as politely knocking on it, even as the wood began to splinter in the middle from the repeated thudding of boots. Finally, someone from a floor down loaned their circular saw, and after dulling two of his blades, they finally cut through the wall of curious fibers, their split ends fraying outwards like cut piano wire. The smell was the first thing they noticed, an odor so foul it seemingly leeched the hallway of oxygen. The second thing they noticed was the tunnel of perfectly circular holes, cut 15 feet wide in the ceilings and floors for a dozen levels going upwards and downwards.\n\nThe third was Ms. Ericson, suspended above the ceiling hole in a thick blanket of cobwebs, eyes and mouth sewn shut. As the flashlight beam swept over her, one of the officers noticed her skin beginning to crawl.",

A deafening stutter crawled from his friends' mouths, like a writhing caterpillar. \"Happy Birthday ttttttttttttttttttttt--\" They trilled, frozen in a millisecond in time, fingers twitching so fast they appeared to be in four places at once. He had broken something, he was sure - could he break his way out?\n\nHe ran to the door, but his feet dragged along the ground as if magnetized, unable to lift even a centimeter off the soft, yielding wood. He tried jiggling the handle of the door leading to the back porch. But there never was a back porch. Just a black void behind an immovable glass door, darkness at once seemingly stretching for a thousand miles and right in front of his face like a sheet of black paper.\n\nFrom the living room the sound of his friends grew louder. Ttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.\n\nTtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.\n\nTttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.",

His hands trembled and his sight grew hazy as he reached for the door handle and weakly pulled it open.\n\nThere was nothing but jackets, shoes and three unassuming walls. He tried to scream, but no sound came out.",

We learned that no burgeoning love affair, no prelude to an epic romance is too grand in scale to triumph against the sheer nutritional value of an onion. We learned goblins are real. And finally, we learned that when you invite your boss over for dinner, you should always make sure to rip off your toilet seat cover and drape it over a nearby wooden slat of indiscernible origin.

His hirsute golfing buddy that day, who claimed to be a well-adjusted salesperson stopping through town, was actually none other than Terrence Hildebrand, a conniving confidence man who had a knack for getting rich people into space without a way back. Once Pocobean foolishly achieved escape velocity, Hildebrand strolled into his palatial estate and proceeded to leisurely rob it over the course of the next 25 years.",
